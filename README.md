# CompoundInterestCalculator
 Calculates Compound Interest

**Followed tutorial from jamezmca (Thanks SmolJames!) - made slight adjustments to the final summary verbiages

Code requires input from user for an initial investment amount, monthly contribution amount, the number of years that it will be invested, and expected interest rate.

Once user has provided input, there will be a summary displaying The original invested amount, the contributions, the total amount invested, the number of years, the expected interest rate, final compounded value, regular amount, and the difference between the two.
